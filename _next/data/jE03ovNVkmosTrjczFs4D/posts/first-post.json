{"pageProps":{"markdown":"My first interaction with cryptocurrency was in 2013, when a high school mate bought a Bitcoin on Mt. Gox. After purchasing the coin and transferring it to a private wallet, he soon spent it on equipment for his personal project from an online marketplace called Silk Road. At the time, Bitcoin was only four years old and trading at around $80 USD per coin. I didn’t know how it worked—and honestly, I wasn’t interested enough to find out. It was secure, anonymous, and wasn’t blocked on the school wifi network.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has continued its meteoric rise - recently surpassing a $2.1tn capitalization. Because of my early interest in the field, and a stint as a trader on a crypto trading desk, I have become a sponge for people’s opinions on the viability and longevity of cryptocurrency. I’ve heard a lot of arguments both for and against its adoption and the value it supposedly provides. I found that the opinion's of most people can usually be placed into a few categories:\n\n- **Libertarians**: people who believe that Bitcoin is a path for the people to liberate themselves from taxation, and usher in a golden era of financial liberty.\n- **Disinflationists**: who see Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity as the solution to the rampant, fiscally-driven inflation of recent years and even a death blow to central banking altogether.\n- **Doomsday-Preppers**: who believe Bitcoin offers a level of assurance and continuity that state-controlled fiat currencies cannot (like gold/silver).\n- **Skeptics**: all grouped together because their arguments are almost identical: that cryptocurrency is a pyramid scheme, a scam, and a bubble, with no intrinsic value other than the potential to be sold at a higher price.\n\nThese groups aren’t mutually exclusive, and I’ve met plenty of people who can sit in two or three at once—sometimes all four, depending on the day. Each of these groups reflect narratives that have emerged around digital money—part political, part economic, and part reactionary to a system that many see as increasingly unstable. Underneath it all is a preoccupation not with the coins themselves, but with what they represent: a shifting vision of power, value, and who gets to decide how the financial world operates.\n\nThe arguments of those who embrace currencies like Bitcoin are persuasive, and more people are moving from being skeptics to proponents than vice versa. The most compelling case I see against the complete obsolescence of state-backed currency is this: for millennia, the authority of the nation-state has relied on its ability to raise revenue. Without taxation, there can be no welfare system, no functioning police force, no public infrastructure, no military, and no publicly funded education—none of the institutions we broadly associate with a stable, modern society. This breakdown of state power is not just intolerable to those already in power, but in time would become equally intolerable to people around the world.\n\nThis isn’t to say that cryptocurrency tech is useless—far from it. But it does suggest that if a digital currency is going to support the systems we rely on (things like welfare, public infrastructure, and national defense), then at least some control probably needs to stay with the people responsible for maintaining social order. That’s where CBDCs—Central Bank Digital Currencies—come in. They’re basically digital money issued and managed by the government or central bank. Unlike crypto, they’re backed by the state, can be programmed, and are meant to slot right into the existing financial system—potentially even replacing cash.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the idea hasn’t gone down well with most crypto advocates—especially the Libertarians—who see CBDCs as a kind of betrayal. A government-approved knockoff of a technology that was supposed to sidestep the state entirely. And to be honest, they’re not wrong. CBDCs preserve the government’s ability to tax, monitor, and control. They keep the same structures in place that crypto was designed to challenge. That’s why you’ll often see CBDCs compared to things like China’s social credit system—part of a broader fear about creeping authoritarianism.\n\nAnd look, that fear isn’t baseless. CBDCs could be used as a tool of control—tracking spending, restricting transactions, even punishing dissent. But they don’t have to go that way. With the right guardrails, smart policy, and a focus on protecting rights rather than eroding them, they could just as easily become a way to fix some of the deep, structural problems eating away at democracies today. It really depends on how we build them—and who they’re built to serve.\n\n## The Refactoring of Fiscal Infrastructure\n\nOne of the big upsides of CBDCs—just like with decentralised crypto—is transparency. They open the door to an economy where data flows straight to the people actually running things, letting them make decisions way faster. Instead of reacting to quarterly reports or monthly inflation prints, monetary policy could start responding to real-time shifts in how people are spending and saving. For the first time, it might actually move in sync with the economy it’s trying to steer.\n\nJust as importantly, CBDCs could help tidy up a lot of the messiness in our current financial infrastructure. Right now, banks, exchanges, brokers, payment processors, auditors, and regulators all kind of step on each other’s toes. There’s overlap, delays, and confusion. A shared ledger with built-in auditability and common standards could simplify that—not by getting rid of every institution, but by giving them a shared playbook. One that’s modular, flexible, and way easier to update than legacy systems like SWIFT.\n\nWith that real-time data baked into the system itself, governments could even start simulating the effects of new policies before rolling them out—basically A/B testing fiscal decisions on live behavioural data. It’s not a perfect system, but it’s a step toward something smarter. Less guesswork, fewer blind spots, and trust built into the structure instead of just assumed.\n\n## The Reallocation of Tax Dependence\n\nCBDCs could also set the stage for a smarter, leaner, and maybe even fairer tax system. If everyone has a wallet connected to a national ledger, the government suddenly has a way better view of the economy—not just income, but spending, saving, asset flows, the works. That visibility could allow us to move away from taxing labour (which we want more of) and start focusing on taxing consumption and accumulated wealth (which we don’t track as well right now).\n\nTokenised assets make a big difference here. If ownership—of stocks, houses, you name it—is all on-chain, wealth becomes harder to hide. That opens the door to more tailored taxes: think a progressive consumption tax that scales with lifestyle, or asset-based levies that adjust in real time as prices move. No more relying on stale annual estimates or opaque valuations. In this world, wealth isn't buried in shell companies or offshore trusts—it’s in your wallet like everything else.\n\nThat doesn’t mean everyone’s financial life needs to be public. Privacy-preserving tech and strict access controls would be key. But the underlying structure would finally support a tax system that reflects how people actually live. Less effort spent chasing down cheaters, more time designing a system that just works. Ideally, one where funding public goods feels natural—not like a punishment for doing the right thing.\n\n## The Virtualisation of Governance\n\nThe reach of CBDCs could go well beyond the economy. They might also quietly reshape how we govern ourselves. If every citizen has a verified wallet, you’ve already got the infrastructure for more direct involvement in democracy. Not just casting a vote every few years, but actually having a say in policies as they evolve. Things like liquid democracy, quadratic voting, or participatory budgeting—ideas once seen as too messy or insecure—start to look way more viable when identity and auditability are built into the system itself.\n\nWe’ve seen a version of this work in Switzerland. Their system of regular referenda has helped keep civic engagement high. But even they run into limitations—paper ballots, administrative lag, and so on. A digital system layered over a CBDC could take that same spirit of participation and scale it, speed it up, and bring it into more areas of life. In some ways, it starts to resemble DAOs—those early, clunky experiments in decentralised governance where rules are set by the group and enforced by code.\n\nOf course, none of it matters without trust. And trust depends on good information. Without some shared grasp of reality—on what’s happening in the world around us—we can’t make meaningful decisions together. That’s where oracles come in: systems that pipe real-world data into digital protocols. Done right, they help re-establish a common reference point—not absolute truth, maybe, but enough clarity to compromise, decide, and move forward. In a world where it feels like everyone’s fighting over what’s real, maybe step one is just building systems that help us recalibrate.\n\n## Asset Ownership in the Age of AI\n\nAs we inch closer to the possibility of general AI, a lot of the old assumptions in economics start to wobble. So much of what we believe about value and fairness is built on the idea that humans create value through work. But if machines start doing it better—physically and intellectually—that whole foundation starts to crack.\n\nThe question then becomes: who benefits? Our current systems—inheritance, capital gains, speculative markets—weren’t built for a world where value is generated without people. CBDCs aren’t a magic fix, but they could give us the tools to try new approaches. Stuff like universal basic income, dividends tied to automated productivity, or totally new fiscal ideas that haven’t even been named yet. At the very least, CBDCs give us the rails to run those experiments—faster, cleaner, and with more transparency than we’ve got now.\n\nWhat CBDCs make possible is less about money itself and more about the systems that surround it. With every citizen holding a wallet, with every transaction traceable and programmable, we gain a kind of civic infrastructure that could make the old social contract feel less like a metaphor and more like a living protocol. Policies can be more responsive. Institutions can be more accountable. Taxation, distribution, participation—these can all be reimagined with clearer rules and fewer loopholes.\n\nOf course, none of this is guaranteed. A better system can still be used to do bad things. But if we design with care, with transparency and equity at the centre, CBDCs offer a chance to build financial and political institutions that are not just more efficient, but more humane. They allow us to encode values—not just logic—into our systems. That’s not a promise of utopia. It’s something more durable: a chance to do better.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
